## The Problem
Toronto is a **BIG** city. With over 6 million people in the GTA, every year thousands of people move into rentals in the city.

Every person who moves has a image in their mind. A vision of the perfect apartment. With the correct number of bedrooms, a nifty layout, a classy colour scheme and of course the right price.

This part of the dream can already be fufilled with current technology. On sites like Kajiji, Craigslist and many others, apartments can be browsed by the thousands, descriptions read, photos viewed and sooner or later a suitable candidate is found.

However, there is more to this vision than just the apartment itself, perhaps factors even more important. Is the area safe? Is it transit accessible? Is it near a school? All these ingredients are crucial to selecting a new place to live and without knowing the area firsthand it is almost impossible to find out about them.

## Our Solution
Hoodie attempts to close this information gap. Our mission statement is to empower people to find living spaces that suit their lifestyles and individual needs. Whether you are looking for the hustle and bustle of downtown or just want to live by a quiet park, we are dedicated to make your search easier and more productive.

Hoodie enables users to apply advanced spatial analysis techniques when looking for a new place to rent. We do this by integrating data from many sources into one multi-criteria spatial decision making engine. Each available apartment is given a score based on many criteria, such as; distance to schools, restaurant density, and safety level. The user then inputs which criteria is important to them and the app compute the top 10 apartments that will provide the best fit for their personal needs.

In addition to regular filters like price and number of bedrooms, our app sorts through 11 types of spatial data including:
0. Distance to schools
0. Distance to Parks
0. Distance to Subway stations
0. Distance to Libraries
0. DIstance to Points of Interest and Entertainment
0. Distance Gyms
0. Distance to a Supermarket
0. Restaurant Density
0. Cafe Density
0. Density of Bars
0. Saftey
